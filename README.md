# App Name

After Party!

# Criteria

This website is a great tool to be able to find events, and hotels in an area, all in one place, so you don't need to waste time searching multiple websites! 

# Contributions
For this project I mainly focused on two things, finding a hotel api that could work and follows CORS, then, that was able to have the most important data of hotels. Second thing I worked on was the use of Bulma's card element that we could use between events and hotels. I also assisted on some Bulma styling for our website as well as cleaning up the code.
